define names array consisting of 6 names

define empty weights array
define empty heights array
define empty bmis array

define value underweight as 0 for counter
define value normalweight as 0 for counter
define value overweight as 0 for counter

define function bmi that takes in two parameters, weight and height:
    return the calculated BMI using the formula (weight * 703)/(height^2)

define function bmi class that takes in one parameter, bmi:
    if bmi is less than 18.5:
        return a string "Underweight"
    otherwise, if bmi is less than 25 (bmi is less than 25 but greater than 18.5):
        return a string "Normalweight"
    otherwise (bmi is greater than or equal to 25):
        return "overweight"

iterate for every name in the names array:
    add to the weights array, prompting for user input "What is (the current name in names array)'s weight in pounds?"
    add to the heights array, prompting for user input "What is (the current name in names array)'s height in inches?"

define an iterative counter "i" that starts at 0

as long as "i" is less than the length of the weights array:
    append the bmis array with the returned value of the bmi function, given the weights and heights of value i in the arrays. 
    iterate the counter "i" + 1

iterate for every bmi in the bmi array:
    if the function bmiClass with the current bmi returns "Underweight"
        increase the underweight counter by 1
    othersie if the function bmiClass with the current bmi returns "Normal weight"
        increase the normalweight counter by 1 
    if the function bmiClass with the current bmi returns "Overweight"
        increase the overerweight counter by 1

print the number of individuals with underweight bmis in the group
print the number of individuals with normal weight bmis in the group
print the number of individuals with overweight bmis in the group
