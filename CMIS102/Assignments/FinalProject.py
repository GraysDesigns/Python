# Assignment
# ----------
# The final project involves writing a Python program to determine the body-mass index of a collection of six individuals. 
# [x] Your program should include a list of six names. 
# [x] Using a for loop, it should successively 
# [x] prompt the user for 
#   [x] the height in inches and 
#   [x] weight in pounds of each individual. 
# [x] Each prompt should include the name of the individual whose height and weight is to be input. 
# [x] It should call a function that accepts 
#   [x] the height and 
#   [x] weight as parameters and 
#   [x] returns the body mass index for that individual using the formula weight Ã— 703 / height^2. 
# [x] That body mass index should then be appended to an array. 
# [ ] Using a second loop it should 
#   [ ] traverse the array of body mass indices and 
#   [ ] call another function that 
#       [x] accepts the body mass index as a parameter and 
#       [x] returns whether the individual is underweight, normal weight or overweight. 
# [ ] The number of individuals in each category should be counted and 
# [ ] the number in each of those categories should be displayed. 
# [x] You should decide on the names of the six individuals and the thresholds used for categorization.

# BMI Equation: weight(lbs) * 703 / height(in) ^2
# BMI Thresholds:
# Underweight: ( ,18.5) 
# Normal weight: [18.5, 25)
# Overwieght: [25, 30)
