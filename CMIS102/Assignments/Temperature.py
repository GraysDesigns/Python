# The sixth assignment involves writing a Python program to 
# [ ] read in the temperatures for ten consecutive days in Celsius and
# [ ] store them into an array. 
# [ ] The entire array should then be displayed. 
# [ ] Next each temperature in the array should be converted to Fahrenheit and 
# [ ] the entire array should again be displayed. 
# [ ] Finally, the number of cool, warm and hot days should be counted and 
# [ ] the number of each type of days should be displayed. 
# [ ] You should decide on the thresholds for determining whether a day is cool, warm or hot.
