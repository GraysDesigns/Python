Define empty array 'tempsC'
Define empty array 'tempsF'
Set variable coolDays to 0 for counter
Set variable warmDays to 0 for counter
Set variable hotDays to 0 for counter

for loop (iterates 10 times)
    add to array tempsC by (asking for user input with the temperature in Celsius)

print a statement saying what the following data is
for loop (iterates for every item in array tempC)
    print the data of the current iteration and C to indicate it is Celsius


for loop (iterates for every item in array tempC)
    add to the array tempsF with the conversion of the temperature to Fahrenheit


print a statement saying what the following data is
for loop (iterates for every item in array tempF)
    print the data of the current iteration and F to indicate it is Fahrenheit

for loop (iterates for every item in array tempF)
    if the current iteration is less than or equal to 69 degrees
        increment coolDays once
    otherwise if the current iteration is less than or equal to 85 degrees
        increment warmDays once
    otherwise:
        increment hotDays once

print a string indicating that the number of cool days is to be displayed, also print the string format of coolDays
print a string indicating that the number of warm days is to be displayed, also print the string format of warmDays
print a string indicating that the number of hot days is to be displayed, also print the string format of hotDays
